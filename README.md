⚠️ DuckHunt V3 is obselete and no longer maintained. The public bot has been migrated to [DuckHunt V4](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV4) a while ago, and the DHV3 maintenance period is now over. If you selfhost the bot, you are encoraged to migrate to V4 as soon as possible. ⚠️

# DuckHunt Version 3
## What is it?
The core of the game is to shoot every duck you see. Like a shooter, just for discord! :°)

## I need help. Where can I get it?
[You should check out our website](https://docs.duckhunt.me). Every command, setting and item is documented there.

## I want to use the bot on my server. How can I add it?
There are two possible ways to use the bot. You can either simply invite the official version, or host it yourself (advanced users only).

### Invite link (Official Version)
1. [Click here to invite the bot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=187636051135823872&scope=bot&permissions=68320256)
2. Claim your own server using `!claimserver`
3. Go to a channel you want to hunt in
4. Add the channel to the list of channels ducks appear in with `!add_channel`
5. That's it! You should check out the settings list [here](https://docs.duckhunt.me/) for information on how to tweak the bot.
